<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Vy (that's pronounced like the letter "V") and I'm a computer science major, TAM minor. I'm Vietnamese, love milk teas, and like to bullet journal.  </p>

<h2> Experience and Interest in Web Technologies </h2>
<p>I don't have much experience in web technologies other than Web class and creating a website as a project for my software developement class. I think it's fun and interesting though and I'd like to possibly pursue this as a career. This semester I'm also taking the Design for the Web class. </p>

<h2>What I Want to Learn</h2>
<p>In this class I want to further the skills I learned in Web class. I also want to learn different tools used in web development. </p>
